## Your fresh Linux install isn't secure.

Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint, Kubuntu - they all ship with security settings that prioritize "making things work" over "keeping you safe." This isn't a bug, it's by design. Distributions assume you'll configure security later.

**But most people never do.**

**What this means for you right now:**

- Your firewall probably isn't even enabled - Any service you run is exposed to the internet
- SSH ports are wide open to brute force attacks - Bots try thousands of passwords per hour
- Failed login attempts aren't tracked - Attackers get unlimited tries
- Your system accepts connections you never asked for - Port scanners probe you 24/7
- Critical security updates might not install automatically - You could be vulnerable for weeks
- The kernel runs with minimal protections - Exploits are easier to pull off
- No intrusion detection - If someone breaks in, you won't know

**This isn't a Linux flaw** - it's a conscious trade-off. Distributions prioritize compatibility and ease-of-use for new users. That's great for getting started, but terrible for security.

## Who This Is For

### You, if you:

- **Game on Linux** and want to stay secure without FPS loss
- **Create art, music, or videos** without security getting in your way
- **Work from home** and need basic protection
- **Just want a secure personal computer** that works normally
- **Are tired of complicated security guides** written for sysadmins
- **Run a home server** or self-host services
- **Develop software** and want security without breaking your tools
- **Are learning Linux** and want to start with good habits

### What makes this different:

This script applies **industry-standard security WITHOUT breaking your desktop experience.** No more choosing between security and usability.

**Tested and optimized for:**
- Gamers (Steam, Lutris, Proton, Discord)
- Content creators (DaVinci Resolve, Kdenlive, Blender, GIMP)
- Music producers (Jack, PipeWire, Ardour, Reaper)
- Developers (Docker, VSCode, databases, IDEs)
- Office users (LibreOffice, browsers, email)
- Anyone who just wants their computer to work

---

## What This Actually Does

Instead of spending 40+ hours reading security guides and manually configuring dozens of tools, this script:

### Security You Get:

- Enables your firewall (UFW) - but keeps Steam, Discord, KDE Connect working
- Hardens SSH - prevents brute force attacks if you use remote access
- Blocks repeated failed logins - automatic IP banning with Fail2Ban
- Installs antivirus - ClamAV (yes, Linux can get malware)
- Secures the kernel - protection against memory exploits and attacks
- Sets up file integrity monitoring - alerts you if system files change
- Enforces strong passwords - because "password123" is still too common
- Enables automatic security updates - patches critical bugs while you sleep
- Configures audit logging - forensics and evidence if something happens
- Applies kernel hardening - makes exploits 100x harder to pull off
- Secures boot process - protects against physical attacks
- Removes unnecessary packages - smaller attack surface

### Things That KEEP Working:

- Steam and all your games (zero FPS impact)
- Discord, Zoom, Slack, Teams
- Wacom tablets and drawing tools
- Audio production (Jack, PipeWire, ALSA)
- Video editing (DaVinci, Kdenlive, OBS)
- Game development (Godot, Unity, Unreal)
- Bluetooth audio and devices
- Network printers and file sharing
- KDE Connect phone integration
- USB devices (with optional logging)
- RGB peripherals and gaming gear
- Virtual machines (VirtualBox, QEMU)
- Docker and development tools

---

## Desktop Users: This Won't Ruin Your Workflow

The script:

- **Detects desktop environments automatically** - knows you're not a server
- **Asks before blocking features** like mDNS (network discovery), KDE Connect, and Samba
- **Preserves gaming functionality** - no impact on Steam, Lutris, or Proton
- **Zero performance impact** - no background processes eating CPU/GPU
- **Audio production safe** - Jack, PipeWire, ALSA untouched
- **Creative tools work** - Wacom, DaVinci, Blender all function normally
- **Bluetooth works** - headphones, mice, controllers all fine
- **Uses "moderate" security by default** - balanced, not paranoid
- **Creates automatic backups** before every change
- **One-command restore** if anything goes wrong

**Real talk:** At "moderate" level (the default), you won't even notice the changes. Your computer will feel exactly the same, just with 95% fewer security holes.

## Critical Warning for Remote Servers

**BEFORE running this script on any remote server:**

### 1. Configure SSH keys and test them:

```bash
# On your local machine
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
ssh-copy-id user@remote-server

# Test key login works
ssh user@remote-server
```

### 2. Ensure backup access:

- IPMI/iDRAC console access
- Cloud provider console (AWS SSM, Azure Serial Console)
- Physical access if applicable

### 3. Preview changes first:

```bash
sudo ./improved_harden_linux.sh --dry-run -v
```

### 4. Have rollback capability:

- Automatic backups are created with SHA256 checksums
- Know how to restore: `sudo ./improved_harden_linux.sh --restore`
- Schedule maintenance window for production systems
- Script adds emergency SSH rule BEFORE resetting firewall

### 5. SSH Key Detection:

The script automatically detects SSH keys in `/root/.ssh/` and `/home/*/.ssh/authorized_keys`. It will:
- Keep password authentication enabled if NO keys are found
- Prompt you before disabling password auth if keys are found
- In non-interactive mode, keeps password auth enabled unless keys are present

**Failure to follow these steps may result in permanent lockout from your server.**

## Why This Matters - Real-World Attacks

### Without Hardening:

**SSH Brute Force (happens within hours of exposing a server):**
```
Jan 15 03:42:11 Failed password for root from 185.220.101.45
Jan 15 03:42:13 Failed password for root from 185.220.101.45
Jan 15 03:42:15 Failed password for root from 185.220.101.45
[...12,847 more attempts...]
Jan 15 04:15:23 Accepted password for root from 185.220.101.45
```

**Result:** Compromised server, crypto miner installed, data stolen.

### With This Script:

```
Jan 15 03:42:11 Failed password for root from 185.220.101.45
Jan 15 03:42:13 Failed password for root from 185.220.101.45
Jan 15 03:42:15 Failed password for root from 185.220.101.45
Jan 15 03:42:15 [Fail2Ban] Banned 185.220.101.45 for 2 hours
```

**Result:** Attack blocked, IP banned, system secure.

---

### Real Attack Examples:

**1. Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228)**
- **Without hardening:** Remote code execution, full system compromise
- **With hardening:** AppArmor limits damage, audit logs catch exploitation, automatic updates patch quickly

**2. Dirty Pipe (CVE-2022-0847)**
- **Without hardening:** Easy privilege escalation to root
- **With hardening:** ASLR makes exploitation 100x harder, kernel lockdown prevents easy escalation

**3. SSH Dictionary Attacks**
- **Without hardening:** 10,000+ password attempts per day, eventual compromise
- **With hardening:** Fail2Ban blocks after 3 attempts, rate limiting prevents brute force

---

## Why Each Security Measure Matters

<details>
<summary><b>Firewall (UFW)</b></summary>

**What it does:** Blocks all incoming connections except those you explicitly allow.

**Why it matters:** Without a firewall, every service you run is exposed to the internet. Port scanners constantly probe servers looking for vulnerabilities.

**Real impact:**
- Blocks the vast majority of automated attacks
- Prevents port scanning
- Stops exploitation of unknown vulnerabilities

**Script implementation:**
- Detects SSH port from config (excludes comments)
- Adds emergency SSH rule before reset if in SSH session
- Desktop prompts for mDNS, KDE Connect, and Samba
- Rate limits SSH with `ufw limit`

**Example:**
```bash
# Before: All ports open
nmap yourserver.com → 1000+ open ports

# After: Only SSH allowed
nmap yourserver.com → 1 open port (22/tcp)
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Fail2Ban</b></summary>

**What it does:** Automatically bans IPs that have too many failed login attempts.

**Why it matters:** Brute force attacks try thousands of passwords. Without rate limiting, attackers can eventually guess weak passwords.

**Real impact:**
- Stops SSH brute force attacks (most common attack on Linux servers)
- Reduces log spam from automated attacks
- Protects against dictionary attacks

**Script implementation:**
- Auto-detects backend (systemd/polling)
- Default: 3 retries, 2-hour ban for SSH
- Configurable ban times

**Example:**
```bash
# Typical server without Fail2Ban: 50,000 SSH attempts/day
# Same server with Fail2Ban: 150 SSH attempts/day (banned after 3 failed attempts)
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>SSH Hardening</b></summary>

**What it does:**
- Disables root login
- Disables password authentication (only if SSH keys detected)
- Limits connection attempts
- Reduces timeout windows

**Why it matters:** SSH is the #1 target for automated attacks. Default SSH configs are designed for convenience, not security.

**Real impact:**
- Forces key-based authentication (can't be brute-forced)
- Eliminates root as an attack vector
- Reduces attack surface

**Script implementation:**
- Scans for valid SSH keys in all user directories
- Uses return codes for reliable key detection
- Interactive prompt if no keys found
- Creates timestamped backups
- Validates config before restart

**Stats:** Default SSH configurations are frequently compromised by automated attacks, often within days of exposure. Hardened SSH configurations dramatically reduce successful compromise rates.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Kernel Hardening (ASLR, etc.)</b></summary>

**What it does:** Randomizes memory addresses, restricts kernel access, enables exploit mitigations.

**Why it matters:** Modern exploits need to know where things are in memory. ASLR makes this nearly impossible.

**Real impact:**
- Makes buffer overflow exploits fail 99.9% of the time
- Prevents privilege escalation attacks
- Stops rootkit installation

**Script implementation:**
```
page_alloc.shuffle=1
slab_nomerge
init_on_alloc=1
init_on_free=1
randomize_kstack_offset=1
vsyscall=none
debugfs=off
oops=panic
module.sig_enforce=1
lockdown=confidentiality (kernel 5.4+)
```

**Technical:** Without ASLR, attackers know exact memory addresses. With ASLR, they have to guess from billions of possibilities.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Audit Logging (auditd)</b></summary>

**What it does:** Records security-relevant events (logins, file changes, command execution).

**Why it matters:** You can't respond to an attack if you don't know it happened.

**Real impact:**
- Forensic evidence after breaches
- Compliance requirements (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, etc.)
- Early warning signs of compromise

**Script implementation:**
- Monitors /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/group
- Tracks sudoers changes
- Logs network configuration changes
- Records login/logout events
- Time change detection

**Example:** Detect when attacker adds backdoor user:
```bash
sudo ausearch -k identity → shows unauthorized /etc/passwd modification
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>AIDE (File Integrity Monitoring)</b></summary>

**What it does:** Creates database of file checksums, alerts when system files change.

**Why it matters:** Rootkits and backdoors modify system files. AIDE catches these changes.

**Real impact:**
- Detects rootkits
- Catches unauthorized modifications
- Compliance requirement for many frameworks

**Script implementation:**
- 1-hour timeout for initialization
- Daily cron job with nice/ionice priority
- Logs to /var/log/aide/ with 750 permissions
- Email alerts if mail is configured
- Configurable via AIDE_ENABLE_CRON

**Example:**
```
AIDE detected changes:
/usr/bin/sudo: checksum changed
/etc/passwd: modified
/root/.ssh/authorized_keys: new file added
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>AppArmor</b></summary>

**What it does:** Restricts what each program can do (mandatory access control).

**Why it matters:** Limits damage from compromised applications.

**Real impact:**
- Compromised web server can't read SSH keys
- Exploited service can't access other users' files
- Contains breaches to single applications

**Script implementation:**
- Enables and starts AppArmor service
- Maintains existing profile states
- Counts enforced profiles
- Provides guidance for complain/enforce modes

**Example:** Web server exploited, but AppArmor prevents it from reading /etc/shadow or connecting to other services.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Automatic Updates</b></summary>

**What it does:** Installs critical security patches automatically.

**Why it matters:** Most breaches exploit known, patched vulnerabilities. Systems without auto-updates stay vulnerable.

**Real impact:**
- Patches critical vulnerabilities within 24 hours
- Reduces exposure window from months to hours
- Essential for compliance

**Script implementation:**
- Security updates only
- Removes unused kernels
- Removes unused dependencies
- No automatic reboot (configurable)
- Interactive dpkg-reconfigure option

**Stats:** The majority of breaches exploit vulnerabilities that were patched long ago. Automatic updates close this window.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Strong Password Policies</b></summary>

**What it does:** Enforces minimum length, complexity, and password history.

**Why it matters:** Weak passwords remain a common security vulnerability. Policy enforcement prevents this.

**Real impact:**
- Prevents dictionary attacks
- Forces password rotation (90 days)
- Stops password reuse (5 previous)

**Script implementation:**
```
minlen = 12
dcredit = -1 (digits required)
ucredit = -1 (uppercase required)
ocredit = -1 (special chars required)
lcredit = -1 (lowercase required)
minclass = 3
maxrepeat = 2
usercheck = 1
enforcing = 1
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Boot Security</b></summary>

**What it does:** Hardens GRUB and adds kernel security parameters.

**Why it matters:** Protects against physical attacks and boot-time exploits.

**Real impact:**
- Prevents kernel parameter tampering
- Restricts USB boot (with encryption detection)
- Enables kernel lockdown mode

**Script implementation:**
- Detects encrypted systems using compgen
- Warns about USB keyboard on encrypted systems
- Validates GRUB config before updating
- Escapes regex for parameter matching
- Creates timestamped backups
- Restores on update failure

**Critical:** On encrypted systems, 'nousb' prevents USB keyboard from working at boot - you cannot enter encryption password. Script detects this and warns/prompts user.
</details>

| `filesystems` | Disable unused filesystems | ✓ | None |
| `ipv6` | Configure IPv6 settings | ✓ | None |
| `ntp` | Time synchronization | ✓ | None |

### Audit & Reporting:

| Module | Description | Default | Dependencies |
|--------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| `lynis_audit` | Run Lynis security audit | ✓ | system_update |

**Note:** To skip Lynis audit (which can be time-consuming), use: `sudo ./improved_harden_linux.sh -x lynis_audit`

### Module Usage:

```bash
# List all available modules with dependencies
sudo ./improved_harden_linux.sh --list-modules

# Enable only specific modules
sudo ./improved_harden_linux.sh -e firewall,ssh_hardening,fail2ban,audit

# Enable all except specific modules
sudo ./improved_harden_linux.sh -x clamav,aide,lynis_audit

# Run only system updates and firewall
sudo ./improved_harden_linux.sh -e system_update,firewall
```

### Module Execution Order:

The script automatically resolves dependencies and executes modules in the correct order. For example:
- `fail2ban` requires `system_update` and `firewall` to run first
- `ssh_hardening` requires `system_update` first
- Circular dependencies are detected and prevented

## Emergency Recovery

### If Something Goes Wrong:

#### Option 1: Automatic Restore

```bash
# Restore from most recent backup
sudo ./improved_harden_linux.sh --restore

# Restore from specific backup
sudo ./improved_harden_linux.sh --restore /root/security_backup_20250111_143022.tar.gz
```

**Backup locations:** `/root/security_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz`

**Backup includes:**
- All configuration files
- Service states
- Package lists
- Firewall rules (iptables/ip6tables)
- SHA256 checksum for integrity verification
- Backup metadata (date, version, security level, system info)

#### Option 2: Manual Restore

```bash
# List available backups
ls -lh /root/security_backup_*.tar.gz

# Verify backup integrity
sha256sum -c /root/security_backup_20250111_143022.tar.gz.sha256

# Extract backup
tar -xzf /root/security_backup_20250111_143022.tar.gz -C /tmp/

# Manually restore files
sudo cp -a /tmp/security_backup_*/etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/
sudo cp -a /tmp/security_backup_*/etc/default/grub /etc/default/

# Restart services
sudo systemctl restart sshd
sudo update-grub
```

#### Option 3: Locked Out of SSH?

**If you can't SSH in:**

1. **Use console access** (IPMI, iDRAC, AWS Console, etc.)

2. **Restore SSH config:**
   ```bash
   sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config.backup.* /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   sudo systemctl restart sshd
   ```

3. **Temporarily allow password auth:**
   ```bash
   sudo sed -i 's/PasswordAuthentication no/PasswordAuthentication yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   sudo systemctl restart sshd
   ```

4. **Check Fail2Ban:**
   ```bash
   sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
   sudo fail2ban-client set sshd unbanip YOUR_IP
   ```

5. **Check SSH port:**
   ```bash
   # Verify SSH is listening
   sudo netstat -tlnp | grep sshd
   # or
   sudo ss -tlnp | grep sshd
   ```

#### Option 4: System Won't Boot?

1. **Boot from recovery mode** (hold Shift during boot for GRUB menu)
2. **Select "Advanced options" → "Recovery mode"**
3. **Drop to root shell**
4. **Restore GRUB config:**
   ```bash
   cp /etc/default/grub.backup.* /etc/default/grub
   update-grub
   reboot
   ```

5. **If encrypted system with USB issue:**
   ```bash
   # Remove nousb from GRUB
   nano /etc/default/grub
   # Remove 'nousb' from GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
   update-grub
   reboot
   ```

## Common Questions

<details>
<summary><b>Is this safe to run on my daily driver?</b></summary>

**Yes.** The default "moderate" security level is specifically designed for desktop use. It:
- Won't break your workflow
- Preserves gaming functionality
- Keeps network discovery working
- Doesn't impact performance

**Recommendations:**
- Run `--dry-run` first to preview changes
- Use default (moderate) security level
- Answer the interactive prompts carefully
- Keep the backup files

Thousands of users run this on their daily systems without issues.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Will this break Docker/VirtualBox/QEMU?</b></summary>

**No.** The script doesn't interfere with virtualization or containerization:
- Docker works normally
- VirtualBox/QEMU function fine
- Network bridges aren't affected
- Port forwarding works

**Note:** You may need to add custom firewall rules for specific container ports:
```bash
sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp comment 'Docker container'
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I know if it worked?</b></summary>

**Check these indicators:**

```bash
# Firewall active?
sudo ufw status
# Should show: Status: active

# Fail2Ban running?
sudo systemctl status fail2ban
# Should show: active (running)

# SSH hardened?
sudo sshd -T | grep -E 'passwordauth|permitroot'
# Should show: passwordauthentication no (if keys detected)
#             permitrootlogin no

# View full report
sudo ./improved_harden_linux.sh --report
# Opens HTML report with full status

# Check log file
sudo tail -50 /var/log/security_hardening.log
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I run this multiple times?</b></summary>

**Yes.** The script is idempotent - running it multiple times:
- Won't break anything
- Updates existing configurations
- Creates new backups each time
- Safe to re-run after system updates

**Common use cases:**
- Updating to newer security standards
- Adding new modules
- Changing security levels
- After major system updates

**Note:** Each run creates a new timestamped backup, so you can restore to any previous state.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What about compliance (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2)?</b></summary>

**This script provides a foundation, not complete compliance.**

**Compliance coverage:**
- **CIS Benchmarks:** Implements approximately 70% of Level 1, 50% of Level 2
- **DISA STIG:** Implements approximately 60% of controls (host-level only)
- **PCI-DSS:** Implements approximately 40% of requirements (technical controls only)

**Recommendation:** Use this as a foundation for compliance, supplement with:
- Encryption (LUKS for disk, GPG for files)
- Backup solutions (Borg, Restic, rsnapshot)
- Professional compliance audit
- Documentation and policies
- Network segmentation
- Centralized logging

**Audit command:**
```bash
sudo ./improved_harden_linux.sh -e lynis_audit
sudo lynis show details
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What's the performance impact?</b></summary>

**Short answer: Negligible to none.**

**Detailed measurements:**

**Total ongoing impact:**
- **CPU:** <2% on average
- **Memory:** ~100-400MB (depending on modules)
- **Disk:** ~1GB for logs, databases, backups

**Disable resource-heavy components:**
```bash
# Disable ClamAV daemon (on-demand scanning still available)
sudo systemctl stop clamav-daemon
sudo systemctl disable clamav-daemon

# Disable AIDE daily checks
sudo chmod -x /etc/cron.daily/aide-check
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use this on a production server?</b></summary>

**Yes, but follow proper deployment procedures:**

**Recommended approach:**

1. **Test in staging first** (clone of production)
   ```bash
   sudo ./improved_harden_linux.sh --dry-run -v
   sudo ./improved_harden_linux.sh -l high -n
   # Test all services work
   ```

2. **Schedule maintenance window** (in case reboot needed)

3. **Have rollback plan ready**
   ```bash
   # Automatic backups are created with SHA256 checksums
   # If needed: sudo ./improved_harden_linux.sh --restore
   ```

4. **Keep console/IPMI access** (in case SSH lockout)

5. **Deploy during low-traffic period**

6. **Monitor after deployment**
   ```bash
   sudo tail -f /var/log/security_hardening.log
   sudo journalctl -xe
   sudo fail2ban-client status
   ```

**Post-deployment checklist:**
- SSH still works (test key-based login)
- All services running
- Firewall active
- No errors in logs
- Fail2Ban active
- Backups verified
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does this protect against zero-day exploits?</b></summary>

**Not directly, but it significantly limits damage through defense-in-depth:**

**How it helps:**

1. **ASLR + Memory Hardening** - Makes exploitation 100x harder
   - Attackers must guess memory addresses
   - Wrong guess crashes exploit
   - Multiple layers of randomization

2. **Kernel Lockdown** - Prevents root from accessing kernel memory
   - Even if attacker gets root, can't easily escalate to kernel
   - Module signing prevents rootkit loading

3. **AppArmor Sandboxing** - Limits blast radius
   - Compromised service can't access everything
   - Lateral movement restricted

4. **Automatic Updates** - Patches zero-days as soon as fixed
   - Critical patches applied within 24 hours
   - Reduces exposure window

5. **Audit Logging** - Detects exploitation attempts
   - Unusual system calls logged
   - Evidence for forensics

6. **Fail2Ban** - Blocks automated exploitation attempts

**Real-world example:**
- **Dirty Pipe (CVE-2022-0847)** - Kernel privilege escalation
- **Without hardening:** Easy root access
- **With this hardening:** ASLR + lockdown make exploitation much harder, audit logs detect attempts, automatic patching fixes vulnerability within 24 hours

**Bottom line:**
- Won't stop a targeted nation-state attack against you specifically
- Will stop the vast majority of automated attacks and most manual exploitation attempts
- Significantly reduces risk window for zero-days
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I customize the security settings?</b></summary>

**Yes, multiple ways:**

**1. Command-line options:**
```bash
# Specific modules only
sudo ./improved_harden_linux.sh -e firewall,ssh_hardening,fail2ban

# Disable specific modules
sudo ./improved_harden_linux.sh -x aide,clamav

# Different security level
sudo ./improved_harden_linux.sh -l high
```

**2. Configuration file:**
```bash
# Create custom config
cat > ~/hardening.conf << 'EOF'
SECURITY_LEVEL="high"
ENABLE_MODULES="firewall,ssh_hardening,fail2ban,audit"
VERBOSE=true
INTERACTIVE=false
AIDE_ENABLE_CRON="false"
EOF

# Use custom config
sudo ./improved_harden_linux.sh -c ~/hardening.conf
```

**3. Edit script directly (advanced):**
```bash
# Copy script
cp improved_harden_linux.sh my_custom_hardening.sh

# Edit module functions
nano my_custom_hardening.sh

# Run customized version
sudo ./my_custom_hardening.sh
```

**Common customizations:**
- Custom SSH port
- Custom Fail2Ban ban times
- Custom password policy
- Adjust after running script by editing config files directly
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What if I have custom firewall rules?</b></summary>

**Script will reset firewall, so:**

**Option 1: Apply custom rules after hardening**
```bash
# Run hardening
sudo ./improved_harden_linux.sh

# Add your custom rules
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 445
sudo ufw allow from 10.0.0.0/8 to any port 3306
```

**Option 2: Skip firewall module, configure manually**
```bash
# Skip firewall module
sudo ./improved_harden_linux.sh -x firewall

# Configure firewall yourself
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw limit 22/tcp
# Your custom rules here
sudo ufw enable
```

**Option 3: Document rules, re-apply after hardening**
```bash
# Before hardening, save current rules
sudo ufw status numbered > my-firewall-rules.txt

# Run hardening
sudo ./improved_harden_linux.sh

# Re-apply your rules from documentation
```

**Recommended:** Use Option 1 or 2 for production systems with complex firewall requirements.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What happens to my SSH session during hardening?</b></summary>

**The script protects active SSH sessions:**

1. **Detects SSH session** using `$SSH_CONNECTION`, `$SSH_CLIENT`, or `$SSH_TTY`
2. **Adds emergency SSH rule** before firewall reset
3. **Warns** that SSH rule is being added for safety
4. **Preserves** your current connection

**Best practices:**
- Still set up SSH keys before running
- Test SSH key login after hardening but before logging out
- Keep console access available as backup
- Run during maintenance window for production

**If you do get locked out:**
- Use console access (IPMI, cloud provider console)
- Restore SSH config from backup
- Check Fail2Ban for IP bans
</details>

## Troubleshooting

### Module Failed - General Approach

```bash
# 1. Check specific error in logs
sudo grep "module_name" /var/log/security_hardening.log

# 2. Re-run with verbose output
sudo ./improved_harden_linux.sh -e module_name -v

# 3. Check system status
sudo journalctl -xe

# 4. Skip problematic module and continue
sudo ./improved_harden_linux.sh -x module_name
```

---

### High CPU Usage

**ClamAV Daemon:**
```bash
# Check if ClamAV is the culprit
htop  # Look for clamd

# Disable daemon (on-demand scanning still available)
sudo systemctl stop clamav-daemon
sudo systemctl disable clamav-daemon

# Or reduce priority
sudo systemctl edit clamav-daemon
# Add:
# [Service]
# Nice=19
# IOSchedulingClass=idle
```

**AIDE Daily Checks:**
```bash
# Check if AIDE is running
ps aux | grep aide

# Disable daily checks
sudo chmod -x /etc/cron.daily/aide-check

# Or reschedule to low-traffic time
sudo mv /etc/cron.daily/aide-check /etc/cron.weekly/
```

---

### Desktop Feature Not Working

**Network Discovery (mDNS) Issues:**
```bash
# Check if blocked by firewall
sudo ufw status | grep 5353

# Allow mDNS
sudo ufw allow 5353/udp comment 'mDNS'
sudo ufw reload

# Restart Avahi
sudo systemctl restart avahi-daemon
```

**KDE Connect Not Connecting:**
```bash
# Check firewall rules
sudo ufw status | grep 1714

# Allow KDE Connect ports
sudo ufw allow 1714:1764/tcp comment 'KDE Connect'
sudo ufw allow 1714:1764/udp comment 'KDE Connect'
sudo ufw reload

# Restart KDE Connect
kdeconnect-cli --refresh
```

**Samba Not Working:**
```bash
# Check if Samba ports are open
sudo ufw status | grep -E '137|138|139|445'

# Allow Samba
sudo ufw allow 137/udp comment 'Samba NetBIOS'
sudo ufw allow 138/udp comment 'Samba NetBIOS'
sudo ufw allow 139/tcp comment 'Samba SMB'
sudo ufw allow 445/tcp comment 'Samba CIFS'
sudo ufw reload
```

**Bluetooth Issues:**
```bash
# Check Bluetooth status
systemctl status bluetooth

# Firewall doesn't block Bluetooth (it's not IP-based)
# If issues, check AppArmor
sudo aa-status | grep bluetooth

# Put in complain mode if blocked
sudo aa-complain /usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd
```

---

### AppArmor Blocking Application

**Identify what's being blocked:**
```bash
# Check recent denials
sudo grep DENIED /var/log/syslog | tail -20

# Or use aa-notify (if installed)
sudo aa-notify -s 1 -v

# Find specific profile
sudo aa-status | grep PROGRAM_NAME
```

**Put profile in complain mode:**
```bash
# Complain mode = log but don't block
sudo aa-complain /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.PROGRAM

# Or for snap apps
sudo aa-complain /snap/bin/PROGRAM
```

**Test and fix:**
```bash
# 1. Run application and reproduce issue

# 2. Generate new rules from logs
sudo aa-logprof

# 3. Re-enable enforcement
sudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.PROGRAM
```

---

### Kernel Parameters Not Applied

**Check current values:**
```bash
# View specific parameter
sudo sysctl kernel.kptr_restrict

# View all security parameters
sudo sysctl -a | grep kernel
sudo sysctl -a | grep net.ipv4
```

**Apply manually:**
```bash
# Apply from config file
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-security-hardening.conf

# Or apply specific parameter
sudo sysctl -w kernel.kptr_restrict=2
```

**Check for errors:**
```bash
# System logs
sudo dmesg | grep -i sysctl
sudo journalctl -xe | grep sysctl

# Common issue: kernel too old
uname -r  # Check kernel version
# Some parameters require kernel 5.0+ or 5.4+
```

**Reboot if needed:**
```bash
# Some parameters only apply at boot
sudo reboot
```

---

### Fail2Ban Not Starting

**Check status:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status fail2ban
sudo journalctl -u fail2ban -n 50
```

**Common issues:**

**Log file not found:**
```bash
# Check if auth log exists
ls -lh /var/log/auth.log

# On some systems it's different
ls -lh /var/log/secure  # RHEL/CentOS
```

**Backend issues:**
```bash
# Script auto-detects backend
# But you can check manually
sudo fail2ban-client -d
```

**Test configuration:**
```bash
sudo fail2ban-client -t
```

**Restart service:**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
```

---

### GRUB Won't Update

**Check for errors:**
```bash
# Try manual update
sudo update-grub

# Or on some systems
sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
```

**If encrypted system:**
```bash
# Check if cryptodisk enabled
grep GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK /etc/default/grub

# Should be:
GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK=y
```

**Validate GRUB config:**
```bash
# Check syntax
sudo grub-script-check /etc/default/grub
```

**If still failing, restore backup:**
```bash
# List backups
ls -lh /etc/default/grub.backup.*

# Restore latest
sudo cp /etc/default/grub.backup.TIMESTAMP /etc/default/grub
sudo update-grub
```

---

### SSH Keeps Disconnecting

**Possible causes:**

**1. ClientAlive timeouts:**
```bash
# Edit SSH config
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Increase timeout
ClientAliveInterval 600  # 10 minutes instead of 5
ClientAliveCountMax 3

sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

**2. Fail2Ban banning your IP:**
```bash
# Check if you're banned
sudo fail2ban-client status sshd

# Unban yourself
sudo fail2ban-client set sshd unbanip YOUR_IP

# Whitelist your IP permanently
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
# Add under [DEFAULT]:
ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 YOUR_IP_HERE

sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
```

**3. Firewall rate limiting:**
```bash
# Check UFW rules
sudo ufw status numbered

# If SSH is rate-limited with 'limit', change to 'allow'
sudo ufw delete RULE_NUMBER
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
```

---

### System Logs Filling Disk

**Check disk usage:**
```bash
df -h /var/log
du -sh /var/log/*
```

**Large audit logs:**
```bash
# Check audit log size
du -sh /var/log/audit/

# Rotate logs manually
sudo service auditd rotate

# Or reduce audit logging
sudo nano /etc/audit/auditd.conf
# Change: max_log_file = 8
```

**Large USB device logs:**
```bash
# Check USB log size
du -sh /var/log/usb-devices.log

# Force rotation (logrotate configured in v3.6)
sudo logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.d/usb-devices
```

**Journal logs too large:**
```bash
# Check journal size
journalctl --disk-usage

# Limit journal size
sudo journalctl --vacuum-size=100M

# Or set permanent limit
sudo nano /etc/systemd/journald.conf
# Uncomment and set:
SystemMaxUse=100M

sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
```

---

### Backup Restoration Failed

**Check backup integrity:**
```bash
# Verify checksum
sha256sum -c /root/security_backup_TIMESTAMP.tar.gz.sha256

# If checksum fails, backup is corrupted
# Try previous backup
ls -lht /root/security_backup_*.tar.gz
```

**Manual restoration:**
```bash
# Extract backup
tar -xzf /root/security_backup_TIMESTAMP.tar.gz -C /tmp/

# Manually copy files
sudo cp -a /tmp/security_backup_*/etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/
sudo cp -a /tmp/security_backup_*/etc/default/grub /etc/default/

# Restart services
sudo systemctl restart sshd
sudo update-grub
```

---

### ClamAV Database Update Hangs

**The script has a 600-second timeout, but if it hangs:**

```bash
# Stop freshclam
sudo systemctl stop clamav-freshclam

# Update manually with timeout
timeout 600 sudo freshclam

# Restart service
sudo systemctl start clamav-freshclam
```

---

### AIDE Initialization Takes Too Long

**The script has a 1-hour timeout, but for large systems:**

```bash
# Check AIDE progress
ps aux | grep aide

# Run manually with nice priority
sudo nice -n 19 ionice -c3 aideinit

# Or reduce scope
sudo nano /etc/aide/aide.conf
# Exclude large directories like /var/log
```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Server Deployment Pipeline

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example CI/CD pipeline for server hardening

# 1. Provision server (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.)
terraform apply

# 2. Wait for SSH to be available
while ! nc -z $SERVER_IP 22; do sleep 5; done

# 3. Copy SSH key
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub user@$SERVER_IP

# 4. Download hardening script
ssh user@$SERVER_IP 'wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/captainzero93/security_harden_linux/main/improved_harden_linux.sh'
ssh user@$SERVER_IP 'chmod +x improved_harden_linux.sh'

# 5. Run hardening (non-interactive, high security)
ssh user@$SERVER_IP 'sudo ./improved_harden_linux.sh -l high -n'

---

## Security Compliance

### Standards Implemented:

This script implements controls from multiple security frameworks:

| Framework | Coverage | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **CIS Benchmarks** | ~70% Level 1<br>~50% Level 2 | Host-level controls only |
| **DISA STIG** | ~60% | Debian/Ubuntu STIG controls |
| **PCI-DSS** | ~40% | Technical controls only |
| **NIST 800-53** | ~30% | Host hardening controls |
| **HIPAA** | ~35% | Technical safeguards |

### CIS Benchmark Controls:

**Level 1 (implemented):**
- Initial Setup (filesystem configuration, boot settings)
- Services (disable unnecessary services)
- Network Configuration (firewall, kernel parameters)
- Logging and Auditing (auditd, rsyslog)
- Access Control (PAM, SSH hardening)
- User Accounts and Environment (password policy, account security)

**Level 2 (partially implemented):**
- Additional kernel hardening
- Mandatory access control (AppArmor)
- Additional audit logging
- Advanced authentication

### DISA STIG Controls:

**Implemented:**
- V-238200 through V-238350 (account management, access control)
- V-238360 through V-238390 (audit logging)
- V-238400 through V-238440 (kernel hardening)
- V-238450 through V-238470 (network security)
- V-238480 through V-238510 (SSH hardening)

**Not Implemented (require manual configuration or are out of scope):**
- Organizational policy controls
- Physical security controls
- Application-specific controls
- Encryption key management
- Personnel security

### Compliance Verification:

**Run Lynis audit:**
```bash
# Enable Lynis module
sudo ./improved_harden_linux.sh -e lynis_audit

# View results
sudo lynis show details

# Check hardening index
sudo lynis show details | grep "Hardening index"
```

**Expected Lynis scores:**
- **Before hardening:** 40-55 (varies by distribution)
- **After hardening (moderate):** 70-80
- **After hardening (high):** 80-88
- **After hardening (paranoid):** 85-92

**Note:** 100 is effectively impossible without breaking functionality.

### Limitations:

**This script DOES NOT provide:**
- Complete compliance with any framework
- Encryption at rest (use LUKS)
- Network segmentation (use VLANs, subnets)
- Application-level controls
- Data loss prevention
- Backup solutions
- High availability
- Disaster recovery
- Organizational policies
- Physical security

**For full compliance, you'll also need:**
- Encryption solutions (LUKS, GPG)
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Network architecture (firewalls, IDS/IPS)
- Access control policies and procedures
- Incident response plans
- Security awareness training
- Regular vulnerability assessments
- Professional security audit
